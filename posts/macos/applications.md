# Applications

I use a lot of applications on my mac. Below is a list of the ones that use the most in my day to day life.

## Browsers

### [Firefox Browser Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

* My main browser for all my surfing needs - *which cares about your privacy*
* I also use Firefox for web developing as I find **Firefox DevTools** to be better than **Chrome DevTools**

Firefox Extensions:

* [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) - Secure, open source password manager
* [Bypass Paywalls](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome) - Bypass paywalls for selected sites
* [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/) - Tracker blocker
* [Enhancer for Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/) - YouTube on steroids
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/) - Enforce HTTPS connections
* [Keepa](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/keepa/) - Amazon Price Tracker
* [Octotree](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/octotree/) - Github on steroids
* [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/) - Tracker blocker
* [traktflix](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/traktflix/) - Scrobbles videos watched on Netflix to trakt.tv
* [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - Best Adblock on the block
* [Universal Bypass](https://universal-bypass.org/) - Bypass sites which make you wait
* [Wide Github](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/widegithub/) - Makes GitHub layout wide on Mozilla Firefox.

### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.de/intl/en_us/chrome/)

* I only use Google Chrome for frontend testing, since most browsers run on Googleâ€™s open-source Chromium engine
* Also using [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) for browser automation e.g. for web crawling

### [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)

* My only browser without any Adblocker extensions installed
* Using this whenever I need access to Anti-Adblocker sites or whenever I need to allow tracking cookies e.g. when I want to buy something with Cashback via [Shoop](https://www.shoop.de/)

## Code

### [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) - Code editor

* My main editor that I use to write code in
* My editor setup and extensions are described [here](https://longpdo.github.io/wiki/macos/vscode)

### [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/)

* Mainly using JetBrains IDEs for their Refactoring capabilities and to get a clear separation between work-related and private side projects
* Using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for big work-related frontend projects
* Using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for big work-related backend projects
