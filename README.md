## About Me

Hi, my name is Long Do. I'm a software developer primarly focusing on front-end development. I have experience working in agile environments and am a convinced advocate of clean code. My technical interests cover the integration of internet of things into everyday life, checking out open source projects and to automate repetitive processes via bash or python scripting.
